// Mrs Jefferson is a great teacher. One of her strategies that helped her to reach astonishing results in the learning process is to have some fun with her students. At school, she wants to make an arrangement of her class to play a certain game with her pupils. For that, she needs to create the arrangement with the minimum amount of groups that have consecutive sizes


function shortestArrang(n) {
    let result = [];
    let start = Math.floor(n / 2) + 1;

    
}



console.log(shortestArrang(22)); //,[7, 6, 5, 4])

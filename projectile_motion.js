// Task:
// You must create a class, Projectile, which takes in 3 arguments when initialized: starting height (0 โค h0 < 200), starting velocity (0 < v0 < 200), and angle of the projectile when it is released (0ยบ < a < 90ยบ, measured in degrees). All units for distance are feet, and units for time are seconds.

// NOTE: Some solutions were invalidated because I added tests for situations where the starting height is 0, in which case the equation for height would be in the form h(t) = -16.0t^2 + vt where v represents the initial vertical velocity.


class Projectile {

}



var p = new Projectile(5, 2, 45);
